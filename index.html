  <h1>Marc Charles <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Árpád</span> Stoudmann</h1>
  <p><em>Blockchain Advisor and Devops, strong background in IT Infracture Support, focused on
      <strong>Customer Satisfaction for the Greater Good</strong>.</em></p>
  <p>My name is Marc Stoudmann, known as Árpád in the blockchain community.
    I studied IT and worked for 15+ years in IT Infrastructure Support.
    Currently I am studying full-stack web development to develop my logical skills and further develop my brain.
    Ultimately I would like to code EOSIO smart contracts and be an active developer and project leader
    on the blockchain
    for projects which bring good to all of humanity. I am fascinated by advanced technology, galactic life,
    and generally expanding consciousness in a heartcentred way.</p>
