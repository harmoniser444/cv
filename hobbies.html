    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>This is actually an interesting topic, because I'm moving more and more to a merger between official things I
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      for work, for example, and things I do as pastimes, like blockchain and cryptocurrency. I will therefore only list things I really do aside to relax.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hiking, walking out in the green. Preferably in deep virgin pine forests, where the scent is cool and fragrant.</li>
      <li>Swimming - I have generally always liked being in water, although ironically I nearly got swept away by the current at a young age,
        so I do stay wary of the depths. I keep saying I would like to go and freedive with dolphins and freedive more often in general,
        but I'm not quite certain I still want this. To be tried out and assessed...</li>
      <li>Flying my kite. I have a dear old Zammo Stunter kite which comes from South Africa and is 30 years old, and gratefully, bar a few pieces of duct tape and a new spar, flies
        very well. I would love to get or make a proper basic single line kite, as well as a dual line parasail-type kite to learn traction.</li>
      <li>Windsurfing - I haven't done this in ages, but feel this would be great fun now.</li>
      <li>Motorbiking - I used to have a motorbike, but just didn't use it anymore, and now if I could get one, I think it would be a Harley Davidson, to be able to ride low and slow whilst feeling like I'm speeding,
        and getting real good torque out of it.</li>
    </ol>
